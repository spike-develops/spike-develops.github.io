This is a **Tome** to help mark down my efforts to make a crappy jekyll-github-minimal mistakes tutorial.

Helping Ben make one RN.

He Made a github account

Ben used bundler from this link, I used the rubyInstaller from the jekyll site, so we'll see which one is better
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll 



He downloaded git.

he changed his git username

he downloaded vsCode

git -v didn't work, so we restarted

it worked after restart.

we created the default site using jekyll new testSite

then we followed the **remote site fucker directions of minimal mistakes**

we ran into an issue where some default part of minimal mistakes/jekyll (probably related to the remote theme) did not like that we didn't have a live Git repo with a remote attached. It was solved by just, doing that step. (so i'd just set up the local git repo sooner than later)
