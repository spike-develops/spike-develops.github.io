Trying out stuff for a minimap! 

Ive got a separate camera that is following the main camera, but its using a render texture


Both cameras


IM CUTTING to the render camera, which is doing the move from the room cam to the minimap camera.
54x96

It might be that trying to use the storyboard isn't the play. IE find a different way to show that render texture


I tried controlling tilemap color from separate Tweens, and syncing them up by using the remainder of Time.time, but it really didn't work. I mighta been doing it wrong? but gonna try something else.
