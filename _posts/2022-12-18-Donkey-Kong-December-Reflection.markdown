As I sit here on my mother's lazyboy recliner, gazing whistfully at the yule log on 1:46:30 out of 10 hours on the tv, I think about a time when I was younger. I think about a time when I believed in something bigger than myself. *Nay*, not *something*, but *someone*. *Nay*, not *just* someone, someone who spreads cheer all throughout the land during this cold but joyous month. *Nay*, not *just* someone who spreads cheer all throughout the land during this cold but joyous month, **Dunkey**.

**Dunkey**, and the videos that make up **Donkey Kong Decemeber** every year were the cornerstone of my holiday loving youth. I would wake up every morning of this happy month, full of curiousity and zazz, wondering what **Dunkey** would be posting that day. I remember what I was wearing and feeling during some of his most iconic videos. During [**Super Donkey Kong Shake**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRnMwtdegII) I was wearing a set of overalls my father had recently grown out of, and thinking of the start of chrimbus break. During [**no video today**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGJ6TvKDlvI) I had just recently taken off a particulary tight pair of socks, and was scratching the sock lines on my ankle (thinking of lilac).

 My happiest memory has to be watching the video that kicked of **Dunkey's** December tradition: [**Donkey Kong December**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuvDsT4sRzU). I remember the moment vividly. My father had just disowned me Tiny Tim style, and had roundhouse kicked my out of our 4th story window (we could afford a 4 story house back then, it was the 60's) and I had landed in a six foot tall snow heap. As I sat and cried in my very own fortress of "snow-litude", I remembered my brother and I had recently downloaded the "Youtube" app on our shared sibling phone (luckily it was my day with it). I pulled it out, opened our new app, and what but a thumbnail of **Donkey Kong** himself greated my teary eyes. Needless to say, the rest is history.


*Yours in December,*

Sam
