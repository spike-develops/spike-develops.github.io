Cosmic Collector is a game I worked on for a game Jam. The theme of the jam was *Joined Together*


"Space Tetris" was the concept we landed on, where space "pieces" dock with each other to grow an increasingly large and unwieldy space station. The crux of the game was the physics based docking process, with too many collisions causing a game over.


Originally, the station started rotating after a bit, speeding up as the game went on. It did make the game progressivly more dificult, but it didn't really make the game more "fun." 

It did a good job of ramping up difficulty,
**solution to difficulty spike, and station staying central**

Any increased difficulty from station rotation was now player driven, which 

Any rotation of the station was caused by 

Instead of "I died because the game gets harder after 30 seconds" it became "I died because 

This put the control in players hands. Not only did crashing into the station cause damage, it also caused the station to spin

This gave control of station spin to players, and from testing really increased the enjoyment of blundering.

The best part about hectic games is being the reason for your own demise.
Its fun to be the reason for your own demise.


Cosmic Collector : why being the architect of your own demise is fun!!

In Tricky towers, what's the best part? Its watching the terrible tower you built fall to pieces. 
*Do a graphic where a tower falls, while a stick face gets larger*





In Dark Souls, the time between the screw up and the loss is *generally* imediate. Mis-time a dodge => get hit and die.

In Tricky Towers, the block that ends up being your demise is usually placed **By You** long before the tower ends up falling. Place an awkward block => place 10 more blocks that all show you how bad of a placement the 1st was => die on the 11th block *knowing that you sealed your fate 10 blocks ago*



It does make mastery potentially a lot harder to achieve. In Tricky Towers if the "FailBlock" isn't clearly one block, but a few questionable ones, knowing what to change can be tough. (should i compare to DS here?)

This isn't to say that separation like that is better in every way. The immediate punishment in Dark Souls is how its able to keep
