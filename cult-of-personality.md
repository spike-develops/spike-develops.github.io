[**Cult of Personality is Out NOW on Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1699290/Cult_of_Personality/)

Cult of Personality is a 5-8 player online social deception game that bends the rules of what players can see, do, and hear... In life, and in death!

Working on some new devlogs about the development process. For now, here's a few videos showing off some systems and gameplay, and how they compare to Among Us.

Searchables replace the "task" system from Among Us, having players look/listen for pulsing objects to interact with.

Mirrors replace "vents" from Among Us, allowing traitors to secretly navigate around the map, and "possess" things and other players.
