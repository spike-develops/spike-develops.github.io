<h3>2023 GMTK 48 hour Jam - 'Roles Reversed' Theme</h3>
A twist on Connect four, where you play as the mimic-ified board, and don't want EITHER player to win. Two AI controlled players play against each other, while the player can shift any row of fallen pieces to the left or right. 

This changes the game to pseudo Tetris - where players manage the possible wins for both colors, and try to force a stalemate by filling the board.
